# SIR Modelling of spread of COVID-19 ðŸ¦ 

### Model 1. SIR model for an infectious disease:
The SIR model breaks down the population into three-subgroups on the basis of infection.

* **Susceptible.** The subpopulation at risk of contracting the disease
* **Infectious.** The subpopulation that has become infected.
* **Recovered.** The subpopulation that has recovered from infection and is thought to be immune to the disease.

### Model 2. SEIR model:
The SEIR model extends the SIR model by adding an additional population compartment containing those individuals who have been exposed to the virus but not yet infective.
* **Exposed.** The subpopulation that has been exposed to the disease but not yet infective.

### Model 3. SEIR model with Control:
With vaccines and social distancing norms designed to reduce transmission of the virus from individuals in the infective state to susceptible individuals.
We provide a control **parameter u** to indicate the success of these attempts for modelling purposes. u=0 denotes no controls, while u=1 denotes complete isolation of infective individuals. The goal of this model is to see how a social distancing approach influences an epidemic's outcome.

### Simulation of SIR model using Mesa Agent-based modelling: ðŸ“º
Model the spread of COVID-19 using a model based on the SIR model (susceptible, infectious, recovered). The cells are arranged in a grid and several agents (people) migrate between adjacent cells, potentially infecting one another.

**Assumptions:**
* We have a set number of agents (adjustable parameter) who are given random cells in the grid at the start.
* Throughout the simulation, a fixed percentage (adjustable parameter) of the agents are masked or unmasked.
* At every step, an agent either stays at his/her cell or moves to an adjacent one.
* When a susceptible agent is in the same cell as an infected agent, the chance of infection (adjustable parameter) differs between masked and unmasked agents.
* If an agent is infected, he/she recovers and becomes immune after a certain number of simulation steps (adjustable parameter).
* Immunity goes away after a certain number of steps (adjustable parameter) and the agent becomes susceptible once again.

**Visuals:**
* Agents will be represented as circles in our grid.
* Susceptible agents are blue, infected are orange, recovered and immune are green.
* If a circle is (not) filled it means the agent is (not) masked.
